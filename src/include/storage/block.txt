Each data file (heap or index) is divided into disk blocks
(which may be thought of as the unit of i/o 
A buffer contains exactly one disk block).  


BlockId:

 This is a storage type for BlockNumber. 
 This type is used for on-disk structures (e.g., in HeapTupleData) 
 whereas BlockNumber is the type on which calculations are performed 
 
 BlockIds can be SHORTALIGN'd (and therefore any
 structures that contains them, such as ItemPointerData, can also be
 SHORTALIGN'd).  this is an important consideration for reducing the
 space requirements of the line pointer (ItemIdData) array on each
 page and the header of each heap or index tuple.
 
Invalid block id is a 32-bit number where all bits are 1: 0xFFFFFFFF
